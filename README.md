Turtlebot Lab Tools
===================

Packages for facilitating interfacing with the Turtlebot. The Turtlebot is controlled from a **commander** machine, which communicates with the robot over a ROS network.

Refer to the wiki attached to this repository for instructions on setup and running the code. Even if you don't know ROS or Linux you should be able to get the code running without any problems.
